```
AndroidIDE build tools installer
This script helps you easily install build tools in AndroidIDE.

Usage:
./scripts/idesetup -s 35.0.2 -c -j 17
This will install Android SDK 35.0.2 with command line tools and JDK 17.

Options :
-i   Set the installation directory. Defaults to $HOME.
-s   Android SDK version to download.
-c   Download Android SDK with command line tools.
-m   Manifest file URL. Defaults to 'manifest.json' in 'androidide-tools' GitHub repository.

```

## Installing in AndroidIDE
- Open the AndroidIDE terminal.
- Start the installation process by executing : `idesetup -c`
- After you execute the command, it'll show a summary of the configuration. Type `y` to confirm the configuration and start the installation process.

The default configuration is enough for most users. If you want to configure the installation process (like downloading a different SDK tools version), you can do so by using the options provided by the script.

Execute the script with `-h` option to see a list of options that you can use.

## Download
You can manually download and install these tools from [releases](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/androidide-build-tools/releases). A step-by-step guide is available on [our blog](https://androidide.com/blogs/getting-started/2023/07/17/manually-installing-build-tools-in-androidide/).
